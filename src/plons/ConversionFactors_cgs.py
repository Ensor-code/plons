# --- Conversion factors specific to PHANTOM ---
'''
The SPH code PHANTOM calculates the different quantities in code units,
that need to be converted to cgs units. The different conversions are
given below.
( "cu" in the functions stands for "code unit" )
'''

# Converts the time unit to years
def cu_time():
    timeUnit        = 1.5916423E-01     # [yrs]
    #return timeUnit
    return timeUnit

# Converts the velocity in code units to cm s^-1
def cu_vel():
    factor_velocity = 2.9784608E+06     # [cm s^-1]
    return factor_velocity
    #return 1.

# Converts the specific energy in code units to erg/g
def cu_e():
    factor_energy   = 8.8712277E+12     # [erg/g]
    return factor_energy
